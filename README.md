# Differential Dynamic Programming by Jacobson & Mayne
The original 200 page book "Differential Dynamic Programming" by Jacobson and Mayne from 1970. Scanned with Adobe Scan on my phone.

i think the original paper came out in 1966. the book has been hard to find. o ly one edition. not a lot of copies, and not interesting to a very wide audience. the copy i found was discarded by the UNIVAC Technical Library.
